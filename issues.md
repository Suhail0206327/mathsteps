So here I am planning to share views on some of the issues mentioned in the issues panel. 

## Mathsteps cannot handle quadratic equations #243

So for solving the quadratic equation there are lot of ways that we can do it like using the  
Quadratic Formula: x = [ -b (+-) sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ] / 2a or like splitting the middle term. so I think with proper detailed algorithm we can add this cool feature. I will demonstarte a simple method using javascript two solve the quadratic equation.
